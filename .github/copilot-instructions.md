# Copilot Instructions — wspulse/metrics-prometheus

## Project Overview

wspulse/metrics-prometheus is a **Prometheus adapter** for wspulse/server's `MetricsCollector` interface. It translates server lifecycle events into Prometheus counters, gauges, and histograms. Module path: `github.com/wspulse/metrics-prometheus`. Package name: `prometheus`.

## Architecture

- **`collector.go`** — `Collector` struct implementing `wspulse.MetricsCollector`. Registers all Prometheus metrics on construction. Each interface method increments/observes the corresponding metric.
- **`options.go`** — `Option` functional options: `WithRegisterer`, `WithGatherer`, `WithNamespace`, `WithRoomLabel`.
- **`handler.go`** — `Handler()` method returning `http.Handler` for `/metrics` endpoint.
- **`collector_test.go`** — Unit tests verifying metric values after hook calls.

## Dependencies

- `github.com/wspulse/server` — source of `MetricsCollector` interface
- `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` — Prometheus client library

## Development Workflow

```bash
make fmt        # format source files
make check      # fmt + lint + test (pre-commit gate)
make test       # unit tests with race detector
make test-cover # tests with coverage report
make bench      # benchmarks
make tidy       # go mod tidy
```

## Conventions

- **Go style**: same as wspulse/server — `gofmt`/`goimports`, GoDoc on all public symbols.
- **Naming**: interface names use full words. Package name is `prometheus`.
- **Metric naming**: `wspulse_` prefix, snake_case, follows [Prometheus naming conventions](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/).
- **Error format**: `fmt.Errorf("wspulse: <context>: %w", err)`.
- **Markdown**: no emojis in documentation files.
- **Git**: commit messages follow [commit-message-instructions.md](instructions/commit-message-instructions.md). Branch strategy: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`. Never push directly to `main`.
  - **Pull request description**: must follow the repo's `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Fill in every section (Summary, Changes, Checklist). Do not invent custom formats.
- **File encoding**: all files must be UTF-8 without BOM. Do not use any other encoding.

## Feature Workflow

All new features and design changes follow this process — do not skip steps:

1. **Plan** — write idea to `doc/local/plan/<name>.md` (local only, git-ignored)
2. **Quick discussion** — feasibility + value check
3. **Go / No-go** — kill or proceed
4. **Layer check** — transport layer (wspulse implements) or application layer (write docs recipe instead)
5. **Issue** — repo-scoped work: open issue on this repo. Cross-repo/global work: open issue on [`wspulse/.github`](https://github.com/wspulse/.github). Include summary, scope, impact assessment, priority label + milestone
6. **Design discussion** — API surface, cross-SDK parity, contract/protocol updates, edge cases
7. **Task** — feature branch from `develop`, implement with tests, CHANGELOG entry, PR following template. **Repo-scoped**: link PR to the issue. **Global**: each PR mentions the global issue (e.g., `wspulse/.github#N`); after opening a PR, comment on the global issue with the PR link

## Critical Rules

1. **Read before write** — read the target file before editing.
2. **STOP — test first, fix second** — when a bug is discovered or reported, do NOT touch production code until a failing test exists. Follow this exact sequence: (1) write a failing test, (2) confirm it fails, (3) fix the code, (4) confirm it passes, (5) run `make check`.
3. **STOP — before every commit, verify this checklist:**
    1. Run `make check` (fmt → lint → test) and confirm it passes. Skip if the commit contains only non-code changes (e.g. documentation, comments, Markdown).
    2. Commit message follows [commit-message-instructions.md](instructions/commit-message-instructions.md): correct type, subject ≤ 50 chars, numbered body items stating reason → change.
    3. This commit contains exactly one logical change — no unrelated modifications.
    4. If any item fails — fix it before committing.
4. **Minimal changes** — one concern per edit.
5. **No breaking changes without version bump** — exported symbols are a public contract.
6. **Thread safety** — all `Collector` methods are called concurrently from server goroutines. Prometheus client handles this internally, but verify any custom state is properly synchronized.
7. **Accuracy** — verify metric names, types, and label sets against the plan in the workspace `doc/local/plan/metrics-prometheus.md`.
8. **Documentation sync** — when changing public API or options, update `docs/reference/` and `docs/guides/metrics.md` in the docs repo.

## PR Comment Review — MANDATORY

When handling PR review comments, **every unresponded comment must be analyzed and responded to**. No comment may be silently ignored.

### 1. Fetch unresponded comments

Pull all comments that have not received a reply from the PR author. Bot-generated summaries (e.g. Copilot review overview) may be skipped; individual line comments from bots must still be evaluated.

### 2. Analyze each comment

Evaluate against:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Validity** | Is the observation correct? Is the suggestion reasonable? |
| **Severity** | Is it a bug, a correctness issue, a design concern, or a style/preference nitpick? |
| **Cost** | What is the effort to address? Does the change introduce risk or scope creep? |

### 3. Present analysis for approval

Present all findings to the user before taking action. For each comment, show:
- The comment content and location
- Your assessment (validity, severity, cost)
- Your proposed decision (Fixed / Tracked / Won't fix / Not applicable) with reasoning

**Do not make any code changes or reply to comments until the user has reviewed and approved.** If there are disagreements, discuss until a consensus is reached.

### 4. Execute approved decisions

After approval, carry out each decision and respond on the PR:

- **`Fixed in {hash}. {what changed and why}`** — adopt and fix immediately. Bug and correctness issues must use this path unless the fix requires a separate PR due to scope.
- **`Tracked in TODOS.md — {reason for deferring}`** — adopt but defer. Add entry to repo root `TODOS.md` with context and PR comment link.
- **`Won't fix. {clear reasoning}`** — reject the suggestion with explanation.
- **`Not applicable — {explanation}`** — the comment does not apply (already handled, misunderstanding, duplicate, or already tracked in TODOS.md).

Duplicate or related comments may reference each other: `Same reasoning as {reference} above — {brief}`.

### 5. Zero unresponded comments before merge

The PR must have zero unaddressed comments before merge. This is a hard gate.

## Session Protocol

> Files under `doc/local/` are git-ignored and must **never** be committed.
> This includes plan files (`doc/local/plan/`), review records, and the AI learning log (`doc/local/ai-learning.md`).

### Start of every session — MANDATORY

**Do these steps before writing any code:**

1. Read `doc/local/ai-learning.md` **in full** to recall past mistakes. If the file is missing or empty, create it with the table header (see format below) before proceeding.
2. Check `doc/local/plan/` for any in-progress plan and read it fully.

### During feature work — doc before code

Before writing any production code, create or update `doc/local/plan/<feature-name>.md` with:

1. **What** — what are you changing or adding?
2. **Why** — what problem does it solve? What motivated this change?
3. **How** — what is the intended approach?

Keep it updated as the approach evolves. This is the primary cross-session context for understanding what was done and why.

For bug fixes, the failing test serves as the "what"; add a brief "why" and "how" to the plan file or `doc/local/ai-learning.md`.

### Review records

After conducting any review (code review, plan review, design review, PR review, etc.), record the findings for cross-session context:

- **Where to write**: this repo's `doc/local/`. If working in a multi-module workspace, also write to the workspace root's `doc/local/`.
- **Single truth**: write the full record in one location; the other location keeps a brief summary with a file path reference to the full record.
- **Acceptable formats**:
  1. Update the relevant plan file in `doc/local/plan/` with the review outcome.
  2. Dedicated review file in `doc/local/` if no relevant plan exists.
- **What to record**: review type, key findings, decisions made, action items, and resolution status.

### End of every session — MANDATORY

**Before closing the session, complete this checklist without exception:**

1. Append at least one entry to `doc/local/ai-learning.md` — **even if no mistakes were made**. Record what you confirmed, what technique worked, or what you observed. An empty file is a sign of non-compliance.
2. Update any in-progress plan in `doc/local/plan/` to reflect completed steps.
3. Verify `make check` passes in every module you edited.

**Entry format** for `doc/local/ai-learning.md`:

```
| Date       | Issue or Learning | Root Cause | Prevention Rule |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | <what happened or what you learned> | <why it happened> | <how to avoid it next time> |
```

**Writing to `ai-learning.md` is not optional. It is the primary cross-session improvement mechanism. An empty file proves the session protocol was ignored.**
